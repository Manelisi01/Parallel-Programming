# Abelian Sandpile Simulation - Parallel Programming Assignment
Introduction

This project implements a parallel version of an Abelian Sandpile simulation using Java. The simulation models a 2D cellular automaton grid where cells containing sand grains topple when their count exceeds a threshold. The task involves developing a parallel solution that improves performance over a serial version by utilizing Java's Fork/Join framework.
